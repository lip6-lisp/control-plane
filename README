1.  INTRODUCTION

    The provided LISP control plane implements some control-plane functions of LISP (Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol).
    The program runs in a FreeBSD environment, and is fully compatible with OpenLISP, and can optionally use its mapping socket. 
    It implements map-register and map-reply functionalities (as of draft-ietf-lisp-22), a novel change-priority-message to differently mange virtual machine mobility, and allows registering to many mapping servers with different keys. 
    Please read at the companion PDF short paper for some more details.



2. CONFIGURATION FILE
    
    To implement control-plane, xTR (IRT or ERT) need to know about mapping between
    the EIDs and RLOCs that it manages, and which map-servers to send register message. 
    That information is stored in the configure file. The configuration file includes 
    one section for map-server and one or more sections for EID-to-RLOC mappings. 
    Each sections start by a control keyword: 
    @MAPSERVER for map-server section and @EID for EID-to-RLOC section.

    Map-server section contains a list of map-server (ip address or domain name) 
    with Key which xTR use to authenticate. 

	E.g:
	----
	@MAPSERVER
	193.162.145.50 					lip6
	l3-london-mr-ms.rloc.lisp4.net			lip6
	2001:67c:21b4:109::b 				lip6

    Each EID-to-RLOC section includes mapping between one EID and RLOC(s). 
    The first line of section contains EID's information: EID-prefix, Subnetmask, 
    Time-To-Live (TTL) and Flag. 
    Flag is used to indicate if EID-prefix is registered with map-server or not. 
    Other lines is RLOC's information: RLOC address, Priority, Weight and Local flag. 
      
	E.g:
	----
	@EID
	#Eid-Prefix 		Subnetmask	TTL 	Flag
	153.16.38.0		25		60	1
	#RLOC			Priority	Weight		Local flag
	132.227.62.242	2		100 		1
	132.227.62.243 	1 		100 		0
	2001:660:240::242	5		100		1
	2001:660:240::243	3		100		0

	@EID
	#Eid-Prefix 		Subnetmask	TTL 	Flag
	2610:D0:2121:: 	48 		60 	1

	#RLOC			Priority	Weight		Local flag
	132.227.62.242 	2 		100 		1
	132.227.62.243 	1 		100 		0
	2001:660:240::242 	5 		100 		1
	2001:660:240::243	3		100		0

    Please refer to the original LISP specification [section 6] for more details about the terms.




3. THREAD
    
    This implementation include three threads when start. 
    One is register-thread, it periodically sends map-register message to map-servers. 
    Two other ones are ipv4-reply-thread and ipv6-reply-thread, 
    to receive map-request message and response with map-repy message. 
    One work with IPv4 and one work with IPv6. Note that two reply-thread share 
    two socket (one for ipv4 and one for ipv6) because it must accept 
    Encapsulated Control Message (ECM), which contain map-request message. 
    ECM maybe has inner header in IPv4 and outer header in IPv6 or vice versa.
    
    For messages format and how thread working, please refer to the original LISP specification [section 6].




4. DEBUG
    
    During running, the program prints debug information to console. 
    With control-plane message, the debug information exit in two forms: 
    raw package format (in hexa) and human readable format.

	E.g:
	----
	Raw package:
	Map-Register Packet
